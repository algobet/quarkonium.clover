# Welcome to Quarkonium

## Know-how to Read

* `Quarkonium` is a self-evolved digital asset simulation system, employing concepts from the quarkonium in Particle Physics.
* Infrastructural facilities consist of `BAO`, `BAS`, `DAP`, etc., which are built-in components in [`Quarkonium Space`](), the smart cloud by `Quarkonium™`. `Quarkonization` is the core concept to build those infrastrucutural facilities.
* Constitutional facilities are derived from the concept of [`Dasset™`](), the core simulator to define the entropy in the system. `Dassetization` is the core concept to build those constitutional facilities.
* Simulators play essential roles in the system.

## Your Steps to Go

** Note: **
You should have a `Dasset` account before you start using `Quarkonium`. If you do NOT have one, please request a new one at [`Dasset™`](http://dasset.trade).

`Quarkonium Lab` develops `Quarkonium Space`, a 'baas' based smart cloud service, for the users to experiment various proof of concept.

### Installation & Deployment
Create and run your own `quarkonium` in the smart cloud:
```
.local$ ssh yourId@cloud.quarkonium.org
remote$ sudo docker pull quarkonia/yourId
remote$ sudo docker run -d -p 8888:8888 --name quarkonia-yourId -it quarkonia/yourId
```
Now, you can test at http://yourId.cloud.quarkonium.org

### Get United
In your `quarkonium`, continous expansion can concurrently evolve in the form of `Circle`. `Circalization` is the core concept to build social networking scenes. A set of APIs, named `QPI`, is provided to link the current social media systems, like Facebook, Twitter, WeChat ..., into your `quarkonium`. At the beginning, `VAST`/`V@ST` - Value At Space Time, is `Quarkonium™`'s debut proof of concept of "Internet of Value".

### Get Connected
Communication among `quarkonium`s is called `Interstellar`. Users in a `quarkonium` do NOT know how other `quarknium`s are running, but can propose intentions in various forms via the infrastructural and constitutional facilities or other OTT (over the top) applications. At the beginning, `III`/`I3` - Interstellar Intention Internet, is a proof of concept of "Intention Economy" as `Quarkonium™`'s flag application.


## Our Roads to Go

### Quarkonium Space

`Quarkonium Space` is the `Quarkonium™`'s branded smart cloud, a `BaaS` image hub. `Quarkonium Lab` unlock the `Quarkonium Space` to the open source community in order to support the ecosystem and neutrality. Each implementation/`quarkonium` can run in the smart cloud, a decentralized storage and interconnection solution, or in an alternative decentralized network.

### Dasset Lab

`Dasset Lab` is the `Dasset™`'s branded digital asset simulator hub. It is a core member of the `Quarkonium Lab`.

### Allbot Lab

`Allbot Lab` is the `Allbot™`'s branded artificial intelligence hub. It is a core member of the `Quarkonium Lab`.

### Blokaly Lab

`Blokaly Lab` is the `Blokaly™`'s branded blockchain OTT application hub. It is a premier member of the `Quarkonium Lab`.


Have A Great Day!
